 ## Description
 
 This app is meant to keep a list of saved notes which the user can edit and delete as needed.  I found this homework to be an overwhelming challenge and I did not create a functional version.  I have no excuse. I actually spent two sessions with a learning assistant on this project and at the beginning I felt like I'd had relevant examples to reference in the class activities.  However, as I started I realized I had no clear direction and I began to google a general approach.  I found something I felt was close to what I needed (the link is in the credits section below) and thus started down a rabbit hole which it took the learning assistant that I work with some time from which to extricate me.  In the process I learned about keeping separate files for the front and back end as well as the importance of where those files are kept and what can or should be exported from them.  But I did not finish a working NoteTaker.
